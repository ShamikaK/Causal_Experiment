*Course:* Business Exmerimentation and Causal methods (BA830)


**Experiment Setup**

*Survey:* A typical academic survey which a student/ a researcher sends out

*Audience:* Questrom School of Business graduate students 

*Control group:* No incentive

*Treatment arm 1:* Direct Monetary incentive (Amazon gift certificate raffle)

*Treatment arm 2:* Indirect Monetary Incentive in the form ogf charity (for each response an amount will be donated to a particular charity)

*Treatment arm 3:* Non-monetary incentive (add appealing text/ explanation that urges the goodwill of others)

*Non-interference:* we are excluding our fellow batchmates (MSBA program) and we will use blocking to form random groups of other graduate students at Questrom

*Excludability:* The survey will remain same across the arms with only the incentive changing
